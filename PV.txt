// Hannah Joshs summer idea - Save idea (Example code below)
//	Save to a txt file, use a | to seperate the entires, then pass them to the relevant variables. Please note the below will probably be one very long sentence...

 Name|Gender|CharLevel|Experience|Health|X|Y|Money|Head|Chest|LeftArm|RightArm|Legs|Feet|Finger1|Finger2|Finger3|Finger4|Finger5|Finger6|Finger7|Finger8|Finger9|Inventory1|Inventory2|Inventory3|Inventory4|Inventory5|Inventory6|Inventory7|Inventory8|Strength|Dexterity|Apptitude|Vitality|Luck

// Use the below to load txt text into an array

 string[] separators = {",", ".", "!", "?", ";", ":", " "};
 string value = "The handsome, energetic, young dog was playing with his smaller, more lethargic litter mate.";
 string[] substrings = value.Split(separators, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

// OR

 String value = "This is a short string.";
 Char delimiter = 's';
 String[] substrings = value.Split(delimiter);

 String name = substrings(1)
 String gender = substrings(2)
 int charlevel = substrings(3)
 etc...



// Actual code (Could be used)

 Public boolean Load (stirng fileLocation)
 {
	boolean loaded = true;
 	try
 	{
 		string text = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(fileLocation);
 		string[] values = text.Split('|', StringSplitOptions.None);
 		
 		this.name = values[0]
 		this.gender = values[1]
		this.charlevel = int(values[2])
		etc...
 	}
 	catch (InvalidCastException e)
 	{
		loaded = false;
 	}
	return loaded;
 }

// Side notes:
//	Strength  -  Increases hit damage & Health (little)
//	Dexterity -  Increases attack speed & stamina 
//	Apptitude -  Increates magic damage & Manabar (OR action point Max(?) <- Hannah choose)
//	Vitality  -  Increases Health (Greatly)
//	Luck	  -  Increases RNG for extra item loot



// Introduction plan below (Joshua claims this part of the game as his! (Mwahahahaha) )
//	Begins with a narrator reading lines off a book, with the words appearing as he says them. Certain 
//	 points of the book will require the players input - These will be indicated below.

"Gather round everybody, for I have a tale to tell! Our tale shall begin with a hero, whos name we shall call 
(Player inserts name). Our heros tale begins as a runaway (Insert Lord/Lady), whos very life crumbles as his nation is 
plundered by war. They catch a ride on their best friends ship, in the hopes of 
(Escaping the war/going on an adventure/finding golden treasure) but of course the trip doesn't go as planned. On the 
night of our heros flight the city was sieged and the harbour was blocked. With our heros home crumbling around (him/her) 
they were forced to steal a besieging ship. Luckily (Trained/Dabbled/None (If none then the best friend)) to hijack and 
flee on the captured vessel. Once out upon the sea, our hero watched a smoke rose from (his/her) home and knew there was 
no returning. Unprepared but ready to conquer the journey ahead, our hero begins their adventure!"

Game begins! *Round of applause for creativity!!*


// Top down (Original) pokemon view - invisible grid (Squares are 5x5 pixels) - So player position is (X * 5), (Y * 5)

// There will set prop locations, which must be loaded during the loading screen. Map will move so player is enternally
//   in the center of the screen! As the map will be an island, the edges will be a beach and then some water - will have 
//   to limit the position of the X and Y though. 

// List of what the player can do:
 -	Move N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
 -	Attack, and use actions
 -	Enter buildings
 -	Open a Map(?)	(Map Enum, same as Pause mechanic)
 -	Pause the game
